### Wins + Challenges:

- Wins
  - I was able to finish through iteration 3 of the project.
  - I was able to implement Mocha and Chai tests to implement a BDD approach to testing my code.
  - I was able to use the single responsibility principle fairly well.
- Challenges
  - Completing a project in such a short span of time was extremely challenging.
  - Figuring out how to run the startGame functionality.
  - The createRound functionality was very difficult to figure out.
